# Chapter 10. Joins Revisited
*  Not all versions of sql support right (outer) joins.

*  `natural join` will join tables using identical column names. However, it's better
    to be explicit and type out the join condition.

*   Cross joins are often the result of forgetting to specify the join condition. When
    you want to use a cross join it's better to be explicit and type `cross join` rather
    than just `join`

*   Exercises are no longer being done in VScode because my db client just got pay-walled....
    If anyone is experiencing similar issues I would recommend dbeaver: cross-platform and intellisense
